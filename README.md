# FoodOrderingApplication
This app is similar to other food ordering applications. for the data i have used SQlite and data is in json format.It has both the admin module and user module, admin can add new items into database and user can order any item from the data.

#user module

I have created a static data in json format and kept it in raw folder and retrieved it in the activity as i need to display according to users selected category.items an be added into cart by clicking the add to cart button provided.The items in cart are divided as per user basis, the user's username is stored using shaed preferences while logging in and user stays logged in until he press logout button in profile page.


#admin module

for the admin module i have created an activity so that admin can enter new items into database along with images of food item.recently added items are displayed in admin explore activity while user can see these newly added items in today's special menu ,admin can vists orders activity and confirms the order.admin has ablity to check the application by cliking check app so that he can know all the functionalities of application are working properly.
